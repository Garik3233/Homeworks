        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
            <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="paragraph">
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used 
                for describing the presentation of a document written in 
                a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone 
                technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
                JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation 
                and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
                separation can improve content accessibility; provide more 
                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
                characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
                .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached 
                to improve the page load speed between the pages that
                share the file and its formatting.
            </p>
        </span>
        <p class="par_1">
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible 
            to present the same markup page in different styles for 
            different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, 
            by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and 
            on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for 
            alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
             device.
        </p>
        <p class="par_2">
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority
              scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
               one rule matches a particular element. This cascading 
               priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications 
               are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
               Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered 
               for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C 
               operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
